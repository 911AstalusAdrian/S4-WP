                <h1>Barcelona pre-season tests underway!</h1>
                <p>We're pretty much done and dusted with the 2022 launch season, and now it's time for all 10 teams to hit the track for three days of pre-season running. 
                    Here are some of the teams to watch:</p>
                    <section>
                        <h2>Ferrari - Back to the top?</h2>
                        <figure>

                        <p>On paper, <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/teams/Ferrari.html" target="_blank">Ferrari</a> has everything it needs to return to winning ways in 2022.
                            Team principal Mattia Binotto has <b>stated repeatedly</b> that 2022 is the number one priority for Ferrari, 
                            which has made progress both on the chassis and engine side over the past year - 
                            with more to come from the power unit with upgrades planned for deployment after the August break. 
                            Things have also improved <b>aerodynamically and mechanically</b>. Last year's car has been strong on slow tracks, 
                            although it did have a weakness in the medium speed corners, but has been consistently at the front of the midfield in the battle with McLaren.</p>

                        <h2>Williams - Making the big step forward</h2>

                        <p>
                            <a href = "https://www.formula1.com/en/teams/Williams.html" target = "_blank">Williams</a> has taken many systematic steps in rebuilding itself from the disaster of 2019.
                            Big, structural changes were made within the team, all of which have been in the right direction, 
                            if the steady improvement in the car's performance from year to year is any guide.
                            A team that was 4.2 off the pace in 2019 has, with broadly <b>the same basic car</b>, got that deficit down to <b>1.4s</b> so far in 2021.
                            The ownership change and the subsequent recruitment of Jost Capito to lead the team and his recruitment in turn of the technical people 
                            he has formed a strong relationship with in the past forms the next stage.
                            This in combination with the reset represented by the 2022 regulations all suggest that with no legacy deficit to contend with, 
                            Williams is <b>well placed to make a big jump.</b>

                        <p>Of course, new regulations being introduced for 2022 means that everyone is paying attention to all the teams,
                             waiting for a surprise upset, or a new, fierce rivalry.</p>
